# Minesweeper
This is my rendition of the classic Windows Minesweeper game. It's also my first crack at GUI development on Java.

    Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game.
    The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines"
    without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines
    in each field. The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares.
    Some randomly selected squares, unknown to the player, are designated to contain mines.
    The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square.
    If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game.
    If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square,
    indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines.
    If no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank,
    and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed.
    The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares,
    and may either safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine.
